          My name is Kuba Nowak and I’m a full stack Ruby developer. I
          specialize in Ruby on Rails framework, but I can use a bunch of
          different technologies. At work I do my best do deliver a cleanly
          structured and maintable code and I really enjoy thingink whatever I
          try to create through so that I can apply the best possible solution
          for the problem. As I don’t have much professional experience yet I
          always try to make at least some small progress each day working on my
          programming toolbox. That is why even after work I often do some more
          coding. I also enjoy doing other things like: music production,
          learning languages, watching tv series or playing baseball. My goal is
          to become a really good professional and make my knowledge and skills
          as useful as possible to deliver neat and well-thought-out code.
