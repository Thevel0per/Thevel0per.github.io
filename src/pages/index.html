          My name is Kuba Nowak and I’m a full stack Ruby developer. I
          specialize in Ruby on Rails framework, but I can use a bunch of
          different technologies. At work I do my best do deliver a cleanly
          structured and maintainable code and I really enjoy challenging myself to
          figure problems out so that I can apply the best possible solution
          for the problem. As I don’t have much professional experience yet I
          always try to make at least some small progress each day working on my
          programming toolbox. That is why even after work I often do some more
          coding. I also enjoy doing other things like: music production,
          learning languages, watching tv series or playing competitive video games.
          My goal is to one day become a software architect and make my knowledge and skills
          as useful as possible to deliver neat and well-thought-out software.

              At <a href="https://get.form.com/shelfwise" target="_blank">ShelfWise</a>
              I was responsible for developing all web services and
              maintaining architecture. All the services were developed using
              Ruby on Rails and some single ReactJS components. Main service I
              developed was a web platform which was used to present client data
              and manage resources. It was a large app containing few APIs used
              internally. It could generate client reports which was one of many
              task done in background using Sidekiq. That application also
              contained an extended backend which was processing data that was
              coming from machine learning services. For communication with ML
              services it used RabbitMQ handled by Bunny and Sneakers gems. I
              was working on all of these features as well as importing data to
              the system through a CSV files and some other stuff. This
              project was roughly 70% backend, 30% frontend and I've worked on both. In
              addition to that I've also done some minor works on service that
              was handling client data injections and I've handled few
              Kubernetes deployments and other resources.

              I was hired to <a href="https://sperasoft.com/" target="_blank">Sperasoft</a> to
              be a part of the team that was responsible for live-ops and development of the
              lottery games applications for a scandinavian client. I was the first Ruby developer
              to join the team then 2 other colleagues joined me. Our main focus was on maintenance and live-ops of
              few different applications, all of which were developed using Ruby on Rails. We also developed new features
              from time to time, one of the biggest ones was a complete rewrite of the reporting system for all of
              the applications. We were working closely with other teams (dev-ops, FE engineer, QA, level 1 support) to fix issues
              with applications and make sure they work properly. There was also a lot of close communication with the client
              to make sure we focus on the most crucial issues first. At first I was working on both frontend and backend of
              the applications but then a frontend engineer joined us and he was handling most of the frontend work so me and
              other Ruby devs mostly focused on backend after that. We worked with standard agile flow using Jira and Confluence.
